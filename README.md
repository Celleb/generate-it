# OpenAPI Nodegen
OpenAPI Nodegen is a tool which will generate a NodeJS Express Server based on the provided OpenAPI (YML) file.

In addition to creating a server, you can also stub the domain layer with auto mock generators by using use the `--mocked` option.

The server will be generated using the [Nunjucks Template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks) engine, which is a port of [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org).

It is strongly recommended to use [boats](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boats) to automatically standardize OpenAPI file architecture and operation IDs.
